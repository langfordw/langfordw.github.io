### Discrete Robotic Construction

My PhD research at MIT took inspiration from biology to ask the question: What are the amino-acids of engineering? (What are the ~20 building blocks necessary to recreate all of engineering?)

This involved developing millimeter scale building block parts, each with a specific function spanning structure, mechanism, electronic, and actuation in order to programmatically assemble small robots such as this walker:

This purpose behind this work was to discretize robotic systems at a much finer granularity than prior work in modular robotics and demonstrate the possibility of assembling useful small-scale machines from a limited set of standard part types.

This also involved developing automated assembly machines. These were table-top scale machines halfway between a 3D printer and a pick and place machine that would take a feedstock of building blocks and a digital design and produce an assembled electromechanical machine on-demand.

With these building blocks and assmebly tools, I built a walking robot that uses electropermanent feet to crawl across ferrous surfaces as well as a "walking motor" that uses coordinated micro-scale actuations to produce long-range linear or rotary motion.

This research resulted in a [doctoral thesis](http://cba.mit.edu/docs/theses/19.09.Langford.pdf) as well as multiple publications and patents including [self-replicating spacecraft](http://cba.mit.edu/docs/papers/17.04.11.SelfAssemSpacecraft.pdf) and the [fatest tethered climbing robot in reported research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12213-020-00128-1), among others.
