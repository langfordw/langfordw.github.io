### An Iterative and Collaborative Approach to Planning

As we planned the remaining work in the feasibility stage of our product development process, we recognized the need to establish a clear plan for the remaining work and do so in a way that brought the team into the planning process. We took an approach very similar to the [W-framework](https://review.firstround.com/the-secret-to-a-great-planning-process-lessons-from-airbnb-and-eventbrite).

- First, the leadership team took time to establish:
    - What are the remaining feasibility efforts
    - What are the top-level objectives for each effort
    - What are the measurable key results that demonstrate that weâ€™ve hit our objective
- Then, as a full-day exercise with the team, we:
    - Provided the team context about where these efforts fit in our product development process
    - Broke up into sub-teams for each effort
    - Brainstormed how we could achieve the stated objectives and key results
    - Aligned on rough level of effort and timeline to achieve these
- Over the following week the leadership team:
    - Integrated the individual feasibility efforts into an overarching plan
    - Adjusted timelines and prioritized efforts based on available resources and program risk
- Finally, as the plans became solidified, we kicked off work on the individual efforts with small/autonomous teams

This collaborative approach helped identify blind-spots and ensure everyone was fully committed to the plan, setting our team up for success as we moved into the next phase of product development.
