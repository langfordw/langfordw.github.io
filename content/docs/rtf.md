### Rapid Task Force -- System Integration

Bring-up and integration of a new prototype is always a challenge and often takes longer than is budgeted for. We experienced major challenges with the bring-up of one of our prototypes that dragged on. We new there was a serious problem.

To solve the problem we needed to create a sense of urgency and focus the team. We formed a “Rapid Task Force” (RTF) – a small cross-disciplinary team of people whose sole focus would be to solve these integration challenges.

We convened daily standups to check in on progress, reveal any issues or blockers, and triage the work for the day. We set weekly goals with daily progress targets that we worked toward. This gave everyone a clear sense of how things were progressing.

I joined the team “in the mud,” dropping a number of responsibilities to make this my primary focus. Together, we stamped out a series of complex system integration challenges spanning: electrical, material/chemistry, structural, electromechanical, and procedural (calibration). 

Over a three week period of time we went from no qualified instruments in the lab to multiple instruments running successful biological applications. These instruments went on to be used for internal collaborator demonstrations and multiple external deployments.
