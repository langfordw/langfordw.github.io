    <p>Bloombot is an personal automated hydroponic growing system. I entered it, with help from others in the Tufts Robotics Club, in the <a href="http://ricc.wpi.edu/">RICC Competition (Robotics Innovations Competition and Conference)</a> at Worcester Polytechnic Institue. The theme of the competition was to develop innovative robotic solutions to improve people's quality of life. My goal was to create a system that made growing plants and herbs in the home throughout the year easier.</p>

    <p>Bloombot uses a method of hydroponics called deep water culture in which the plant roots are suspended in a highly oxygenated nutrient solution. This allows for a highly efficient transfer of nutrients directly from the water solution to the roots.</p>

    <p>The system features a number of sensors which detect water level and light intensity. The whole system is controlled over the internet via Twitter such that a user can simply tweet @Bloombot to turn the lights or pump on or off. Bloombot will also send a tweet if it detects a change in its state (e.g., one of the lights went out unexpectedly or the water level dropped below a certain level).</p>

    <p>Design files for the enclosure are posted on <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1190">Thingiverse</a> and you can read a bit more about the project on the <a href="http://www.tuftsroboticsclub.com/current-projects/bloombot">Tufts Robotics Club website</a>.</p>
